# Foundations Overview

The primary focus for the Foundational component of Holberton is to achieve mastery of fundamental engineering concepts and become skilled in coding.

Professional Development will be a key supplement to this primary goal; some of it will be experienced explicitly while other times you’ll be learning as you go along perhaps without recognizing until you’ve been able to look back on your progress.

At the conclusion of Foundations, students will have acquired a strong foundation of technical knowledge from which they can either build upon with a Specialization or begin preparing for interviews and jobs as part of Holberton’s interview prep, Career Sprint*.
